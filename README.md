<h3>Before start:</h3>

Jhangkar Mahbub Bhai has asked to do this project as an assignment. Almost everything I have learned in four months has to be applied in this project. There is some fear in the mind. But there is nothing to do. Fear must be overcome. However, I decided to create a travel related project. Let's see how much I can do.

<h3>React Router:</h3>

First, I install react router and setup it on app.js. And connect some pages with router. To install react router I had to command npm install react-router-dom.

<h3>Font Awesome:</h3>

To interective this project I use some icon from fontaweome.com.

<h3>Firebase:</h3>

I include firebase authentication in react project. There are two type authentication. One is email-password sign in and another is google sign in method.
