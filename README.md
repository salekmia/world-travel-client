<h3>Before start:</h3>

Jhangkar Mahbub Bhai has asked to do this project as an assignment. Almost everything I have learned in four months has to be applied in this project. There is some fear in the mind. But there is nothing to do. Fear must be overcome. However, I decided to create a travel related project. Let's see how much I can do.

<h3>React Router:</h3>

First, I install react router and setup it on app.js. And connect some pages with router. To install react router I had to command npm install react-router-dom.

<h3>Font Awesome:</h3>

To interective this project I use some icon from fontaweome.com.

<h3>Firebase:</h3>

I include firebase authentication in react project. There are two type authentication. One is email-password sign in and another is google sign in method.

<h3>React hook form:</h3>

For create a form I used react hook form. Becouse it's very easy and it save a lot of time. If I use react hook form I don't have to use useState to take every single input value.

<h3>CRUD:</h3>
Post method is one of the importent method in CRUD operation. You can insert services from client site. And it's totally dynamic. It's pretty coll right?

<h3>Error handling:</h3>
If you want to do a project, you have to read many problems. They have to be solved gradually. I also faced some problems while doing this project. E.g.

* Brower reload issue
* syntex error
* type error
